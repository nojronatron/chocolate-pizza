# chocolate-pizza

In preparation for Code Fellow's Code301 class, students enrolled in Code201 are required to work through this challenge in a 4-hr timeboxed pair-programming challenge. Actually completing the design is not required, but experiencing paired programming in a time-limited setting with a hard stop requirement will help prepare students for the real world.

## Chocolate Pizza Project Goals

- Build a single-page website, from scratch.  
- Use only HTML and CSS (stretch goal: add javascript).  
- Avoid Float and negative transforms and translate properties.  
- Try to make your web page pixel-perfect to [PREVIEW.png](./imgs/PREVIEW.png).  

## Motivation

When I took Code201, my CSS skills were not up to the challenge and my partner and I were not able to complete the challenge. However, we were able to make pretty good progress and I thought I could do better.  

Students that test-in to Code Fellow's Code 301 course are asked to complete this challenge by *completing the design in its entirety*, and not in a strict timeboxed, pair-programming environment.

Since I'm entering Code 301 after completing Code 201, I thought I would hold myself to the same standard as those that tested-in to the Code 301 class.

I believe it is always a good idea to challenge myself, it's just a matter of *when* I sit down to do it. This was the time.

## Technology Used

Purely HTML5 and CSS 3. No javascript, no other frameworks.

## Credits

A small portion of the CSS was lifted from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7463391/how-to-create-open-square-checkbox-style-list-marker-for-html-unordered-list) to create the 'checkable' checkboxes. My thanks (and an upvote) go to Joseph Marikle for the Sep 18, 2011 solution.
